/A Highly Extensible Chemical Formula Builder and Molecular Editor with Regulatory
Intelligence written in Guile./

This project is still in the ideation stage - I'm still in the process of determining the
inner workings, let alone the UI system to implement it with (though considering guile-sdl2).
I would like to leverage Hoot at some point to create a web application. That said, I am
still learning Guile and figured this would be a great way to dive in!

* Goals

  My first goal is to develop a simple database (integrated with JSON) that can store/access
  molecular, raw material, formula, and regulatory data types. Second is to develop the
  formula builder and Molecular editor UI's, perhaps using GOOPS. Thirdly is to develop the
  regulatory intelligence backend...

** Install

  Installing ChemScribe using Guix:

#+begin_src sh

  $ guix shell -m path/to/guile-chemscribe/manifest.scm -- guile

  # or

  $ guix shell -D path/to/guile-chemscribe/manifest.scm -- guile

#+end_src


** Run/Load Program
